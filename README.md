# lite-server

Lightweight *development only* node server that serves a web app, opens it in the browser, refreshes when html or javascript change, injects CSS changes using sockets, and has a fallback page when a route is not found.

## Get Started

### Serve the current folder and `./index.html`
Serve from the current folder and open (browse to) the default file (usually index.html) in that folder.

`lite-server`

### Serve the current folder and `./src/index.html`
Serve from the current folder and open (browse to) the default file (usually index.html) in the `src` folder.

`lite-server --open src`

### Serve and log all options

`lite-server --verbose`

## Options

### port
